I'm a Lead Software Engineer at Capital One focused on developer experience and automation :computer: 👨‍💻

I'm based in Asheville, NC ⛰️ working remotely. I spend my free time playing video games :video_game:, hiking :national_park:, or playing with my cats :black_cat:

I primarily develop full stack TypeScript apps with Nx :unicorn:, Angular, NestJS :cat2:, GraphQL, and Docker :whale:. I also enjoy developing in C# and Go and I'm most interested in learning Rust :crab:
